Inventory-App-Test
==================

This sample application was developed to practice using backbone, require.js, less, css, and html5. Below I have listed some highlighted items that I focused on using in this app. 

Backbone
- Models, Views, and Collections to manage data
- Using localStorage to retain data
- Underscore.js to reference templates
- Add, delete, and form reset functionality

Require.js
- Reconfigured backbone files and file structure to use require.js to modularly load files. 
- Made backbone and underscore AMD compliant 
- Optimized 'lib' files (minified).
- Reconfigured index.html file to use require.js to call main.js to load application

Less
- Generated 3 Less files and precompiled them into styles.css
- Used 'mixins' to optimize code resusage and readability. 
- Used variables to reference repeated values.
- Used imports to improve readability and organize style sheets.
- Used css to generate form validation styles
- Incorporated webkit for required field styles and buttons 

Html5
- Use form validation, required fields, numbers, and placeholder text in the form
